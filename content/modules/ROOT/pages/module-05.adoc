= Policy-Driven Governance with RHACM

== Creating Policies in RHACM

In order to assist in the creation and management of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes policies you use the policy generator tool. This tool, along with GitOps, greatly simplifies the distribution of Kubernetes resource objects to managed OpenShift or Kubernetes clusters through RHACM policies.

NOTE: To deploy policies with subscriptions, you will need to bind the *open-cluster-management:subscription-admin* ClusterRole to the user creating the subscription.

Procedure

. Navigate to the *Governance* tab.
. On the top tabs, click on *Policies*.
. Click *Create Policy*.
. On the top switch the toggle to *Display the YAML*.

. Copy the following YAML excerpt and paste it in the screen:

. Enter a namespace to place the policy, the *default* namespace is OK to use.
. Click *Next* till the end and then click on *Submit*.
. Allow a few moments for the policy to propagate to the *local-cluster / RHACM Hub Cluster*.
. Navigate back to policies and select the *policy-configure-subscription-admin-hub* policy.
. In the "Policy templates" select *Enforce*. This will enforce the policy, wait until the green checkmark is displayed.

=== Using Policy Generator

This Policy Generator description will create 2 configuration policies:

* *openshift-gitops-installed*: The goal of the first policy is to inform if the OpenShift GitOps operator is installed on managed clusters.
* *kubeadmin-removed*: The goal of the second policy is to inform if the kubeadmin user is removed from managed clusters.

NOTE: Both policies are informative only, and you will only execute them manually to demonstrate how to resolve issues.

With the ArgoCD resource, you can use Red Hat OpenShift GitOps to manage policy definitions by granting OpenShift GitOps access to create policies on the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management hub cluster.

==== Prerequisites

We need to create a *ClusterRole* resource for OpenShift GitOps, with access to create, read, update, and delete policies and placements: 

*Procedure*

. Create a *ClusterRole* from the OCP Console by Clicking the + Icon on the Top right, then select "Import YAML".

image::04-ocp-console-add.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, OCP Console Add]

[start=2]
. Copy and Paste the following YAML, Click *Create*

----

[start=3]
. Navigate back to the + sign again, you need the *ClusterRoleBinding* object to grant the OpenShift GitOps service account access to the *openshift-gitops-policy-admin* ClusterRole object. Click *Create* once complete

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
kind: ClusterRoleBinding

----

[start=4]
. Navigate to the Terminal in the Showroom tab and execute the following command

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc -n openshift-gitops patch argocd openshift-gitops --type merge --patch "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jalvarez-rh/grc-policy-generator-blog/refs/heads/main/openshift-gitops/argocd-patch.yaml)"
----

----
This command will merge and patch the ArgoCD configuration to point to the latest Init Container that will allow us to deploy the Policies

=== Deploying a Policy with ArgoCD

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Navigate to *Applications*.
. Click *Create application, select ArgoCD ApplicationSet - Push Model*.
* Name: policy-generator
* Argo server: openshift-gitops
* Click *NEXT*
* Under repository types, select the GIT repository
* URL: https://github.com/jalvarez-rh/demo-policygenerator.git
* Revision: main
* Path: dir
* Remote namespace: openshift-gitops
* Click *NEXT* Twice

. Verify that it installs only to the local cluster by setting the following values:
* Cluster sets: *default*
* Label: *local-cluster*
* Operator: *equals any of*
* Value: *true*

. Verify all the information is correct, click *Create*.

It will take a few minutes to deploy the application, *Click on the Topology Tab* to view and verify that *all of the circles are green*.

image::116-governance-topology.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Governance Topology]

[start=5]
. Navigate to the *Governance* tab.
. Click on the *Policies* tab.
. Verify that you see two policies and that their *Cluster Violations* count is one.
* openshift-gitops-installed
* kubeadmin-removed

image::117-policies-list.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Governance Policies List]

Now that the policies have been created for us leveraging the Policy Generator Engine let’s go ahead and enforce them:

[start=8]
. On the *openshift-gitops-installed* policy, click on the ellipses and set policy to *Enforce*.

image::118-policies-enforce-red.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Enforce the Policy]

[start=9]
. Click the *Enforce* button to verify.
. Wait a few minutes and you will see that the *Cluster Violations* will go from *red* to *green*.

image::119-policies-enforce-green.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Enforced]

[start=11]
. Click on the policy and select *Results* to verify that the gitops operator has been installed.

CAUTION: CAREFUL implementing the *kubeadmin-removed* policy, if you enforce this you won’t be able to continue this lab and access that cluster through the console as the only account created on these clusters is Kubeadmin.

== Working with Kyverno Policies in RHACM

Kyverno is a Kubernetes-native policy engine that allows you to manage configurations and enforce governance across your Kubernetes clusters using YAML. It enables you to define policies for security, compliance, and best practices without needing to write custom code.

When integrated with RHACM, Kyverno enhances centralized governance and policy management across multiple clusters. RHACM can distribute Kyverno policies to managed clusters, enabling:
	•	*Consistent security and compliance:* Enforce security standards (e.g., disallow privileged containers) across clusters.
	•	*Automated policy enforcement:* Automatically mutate, validate, or generate resources to meet operational standards.
	•	Multi-cluster visibility: Use RHACM’s observability and policy dashboards to monitor policy compliance at scale.

=== Prerequisites

To deploy Kyverno policies with ArgoCD, you will need to deploy the Kyverno engine in the local hub cluster.

*Procedure*

. Execute the following install script.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/releases/download/v1.13.0/install.yaml
----

NOTE: Script might fail to create the *policyreports.wgpolicyk8s.io* this is expected behavior, you can move on.

Now that the policies have been created for us leveraging the Policy Generator Engine let’s go ahead and have a look at it.

Now you have successfully created a Policy leveraging the Policy Generator to scan your clusters, if you would like to play with other policies please visit the Policy Repo for more Policies you can test out.
